## IBM Spectrum Scale on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start automatically deploys a highly available IBM Spectrum Scale cluster on the AWS Cloud, into a configuration of your choice.

IBM Spectrum Scale is a flexible, software-defined storage solution that can be deployed as highly available, high-performance file storage. This Quick Start automates the deployment of IBM Spectrum Scale on AWS for users who require highly available access to a shared name space across multiple instances with good performance, without requiring an in-depth knowledge of IBM Spectrum Scale.

This Quick Start deploys IBM Spectrum Scale into a virtual private cloud (VPC) that spans two Availability Zones in your AWS account. The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying IBM Spectrum Scale into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying IBM Spectrum Scale into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
